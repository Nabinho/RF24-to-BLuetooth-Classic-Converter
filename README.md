# RF24-to-BLuetooth-Classi-Converter
This devices converts the readings from my [Everything Controller](https://github.com/Nabinho/Everything_Controller) to a simple Bluetooth Classic communication, based on [Bluetooth RC Controller](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&hl=pt_BR&gl=US) standard messages. Accelerometer control also included.
